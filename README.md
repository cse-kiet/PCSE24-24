# Voting-Dapp

Blockchain can be used in developing many real life application that can solve the issue of trustability. Voting system is one of them. We all know a fair Voting System
is an important part on a Democratic Country. Hence in this project we have tried to implement a simple voting solution using Blockchain technology.

Abstract—The inconvenient nature of making the conventional,
physical trip to the polls has been blamed for the rise in voter
disinterest in elections. Remote electronic voting, or “e-voting”
appears to be a promising remedy. In addition to offering
quicker results, electronic voting also solves practical issues,
which may boost voter turnout. However, to foster confidence in
the democratic process, e-voting needs to meet strict requirements
for security, dependability, and openness. Scholarly research
explores different approaches to distant electronic voting, with
an emphasis on using blockchain technology. The decentral-
ized structure of blockchain eliminates the need for reliable
middlemen and allows for safe and transparent transactions.
Blockchain improves voting process integrity by guaranteeing
transparent data storage, offering tamper-resistant and verifiable.
Furthermore, the electoral process can be further streamlined
by introducing automated agreements between users through
the integration of smart contracts into blockchain technology.
Blockchain technology is being used in electronic voting systems
to improve security and transparency while also addressing issues
with trust in the digital voting environment. Blockchain presents
a potential paradigm change in the design and implementa-
tion of remote electronic voting systems, removing the need
for centralized authorities and introducing features like smart
contracts. This might lead to a more transparent, safe, and
reliable democratic process.
